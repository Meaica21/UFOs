# Summary:
   One disavantage I noticed on the UFO page is how the page loads the data. I need to scroll down to view all the contents of the page.
   I would recommend to improve the layout and probably adding page button. Also, adding calendar datepicker on the date input to create additional dynamic events. Another 
   recommendation is when the page loads, the color of the table could change.
